# Python-Public-Library
Created a public Library Script that is ongoing. My First Large Python script since I've been learning.
Functions:
Select a genre, integrates books to cart, shows books in cart, shows updated bookshelf, returns books, and check out books.

Needs Fixing: 
- Return Book function not working properly
- Enhance code features
